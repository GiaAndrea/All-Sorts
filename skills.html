		<h2>The LOVE for ALL CREATURES is the most noble attribute of man.<h2>
</center>

		<p>Throughout history, our lives have been interwoven with animals. Humans used the strength of animals for carrying carriages, even as a means of transportation. Animals such as donkeys, bulls, mules, and camels are used to carry long-distance cargo. They even use animal carcasses for fuel, skins, food, and countless products that allow humans to thrive. (Falvey J. L., 1986) Humans have domesticated animals for thousands of years for their own needs and the most common domesticated animals are none other than dogs–being the first ever animal to be tamed by humans since the Pleistocene epoch (Perri et al., 2021).</p> 
		<p>Even in the 21st century, animal cruelty is still a problem that needs to be solved. While many formal institutions have already enacted laws and policies to protect and support animal rights, many informal institutions that are creating new animal rights standards for our society to recognize continue to be ignored. According to the concept of community in civil society, it is important to encourage community members to take action to be able to fully resolve social issues such as animal rights in this case.According to the Human Society Organization, most of the incidents and instances of animal cruelty involving pets that are reported every day go unreported. Compared to crimes against humans, accusations of animal cruelty are not brought by state or federal agencies, so it is difficult to assess and estimate how often this occurs. However, we can try to understand and prevent incidents of abuse based on the information available.</p>

		<h2>With great power comes with great responsibility.<h2>
</center>

        <p>Everyone has the right and freedom to express their views in any form, whether in writing, painting, and so on. As stated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. As a result, a form of art that aims to raise awareness of society, or Protest Art, emerged. It is a powerful political instrument used by activists, who seek to impart knowledge and promote solidarity. But, to what extent can we say whether a work can be considered art? What is the difference between Protest Art and vandalism? Our rights only end when the rights of others are trampled upon. So there is an alternative and proper way to express our views.</p>
        <p>Everyone is equal before the law. In the headline of Adonis (2019) “4 Panday Sining members nabbed for vandalism”, Panday Sining members were arrested by the police after being caught painting Light Rail Transit (LRT) signs. The messages painted refer to Executive Order No. 70, p. 2018 signed by the president, as it is one of the indications of Martial Law.</p> 
        <p>The Anakbayan spokesperson mentioned in Lalu's (2019) article titled Anakbayan demands immediate release of Panday Sining members, insisted that the arrest was overkill especially that a minor was among those who were arrested. He said Panday Sining only wants to show the people's concerns, about the social issues facing the Philippines through slogan art. But it has become a hot topic among the citizens, in the article written by Madarang (2019), netizens noticed the creations of Panday Sining. They were called stains on the new walls of Manila, and they could not be considered art. We cannot deny that any defilement or vandalism of public or private property is a crime.</p>
		<p>The visual arts can only be judged depending on the eyes and tastes of the masses. As  Alfonso Manalastas (2019), a spoken word artist and a member of the UST National Writers workshop stated that the use of visual arts is inevitable in protest. “As artists, we have to do it on the street. We must bring it to the masses somehow. ”, Manalastas said in an interview. Multimedia artist Leslie de Chaves (2019), on the other hand, said that art can educate people, especially those who are closed-minded. Talent should be used because it can assert and propose opinions in society. The Panday Sining group encourages artists and cultural workers to reveal the truth to society and propose the wishes of the people, using protest art.</p>
		<p>Protest art is a political instrument to persuade and spread awareness in society, and they are often cheap to make and easy to carry such as signs, flags, and so on. What Panday Sining does can be considered graffiti or street art. From the article titled The duality of Graffiti: is it vandalism or art ?, graffiti art is defined as an illegal form of expression that is often placed in public places. "It can be defined by its controversial issues between social, style and aesthetic forms along with vandalism aspects." (Colombini, 2018). In the opinion of the masses, the paintings on the LRT cannot be considered graffiti art because it is not pleasant to look at. Although art can be used to express oneself, it is still up to the recipients to treat it as a work.</p>
		<p>There are alternatives and better ways to express what you want to say. Although the goal of Panday Sining is good, their method is wrong. The right of every person to express using their talent is a power.But, let us remember that there is an associated responsibility with every action taken.</p>

		<h2>Multimedia queen personality<h2>
</center>

        <p>Global multimedia personality is a title that is not to be acquired by anyone, except those who prove themselves to be one. From being the first African American woman to anchor the news, to have the highest-rated talk show in television history. The African American multimedia personality, committed her life to be in the industry and eventually to be a good influence to her fellow. She even had a private charity, The Oprah Winfrey Foundation,  and even supported different charities in line with educational needs, women empowerment, and children and family needs. Oprah Winfrey is a true definition of a multimedia queen personality, every platform and generation knows how iconic and influential Oprah is. She is loved by so many people because of her goodness and willingness to change and be an aid for the betterment of society.</p>
		<p>What you see, is what you get. Oprah is the kind of person who even behind the camera, is not ashamed to show who she is. For so many famous influencers that we have these days, no one can be as iconic or as influential as Oprah Winfrey. She made impossible things for others to be possible. She did not only change how talk shows work or add a word to the dictionary, but she also helped change the lives of people.<p>
